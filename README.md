# Asciiroth
With World of Warcraft Classic still being a little way away, why not enter Azeroth early in this text adventure! 🐉⚔

Hey everybody! So I've been working on this little game project for a little while now and I just want to mention it is pretty early in development and not all the features, locations, zones, races and classes that I'd like are in the game yet, but I'm hoping to add more to it before Classic gets released.

At the moment only Humans and Elwyn forest are in the game, with Orcs hopefully coming next.

## Features / todo

- Basic movement and world grid system [✔]
- Basic combat system [✔]
- Some l33t references [✔]
- Quest system
- Multipart speech system
- Spells system
- Gear system
- Stat system, inc. stats regeneration
